# Regular Expressions AKA regex

Regular expressions are an algebraic way of representing a certain text.
Algebraic, because regex do have pre-defined rules to express the pattern of text we are looking for.

Using the pattern defined by a regex, we can do many powerful operations which would otherwise be very tedious.

This is a very big advantage of regex - simplify the text operations like:
* Filtering (Searching)
* Extracting
* Replacing
* Portable

Note: Regex are not specific to Python! They are a subject of their own. However, Python provides the wonderful library: 're' to harness the power of regex :)
